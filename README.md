# Move to GitLab Windows Script
A Windows script that will automatically clone a GitHub repo and upload it to GitLab.

### Prerequisites
* Git must be installed
* GitLab must already be configured with SSH access form your Computer

## How to Use
Run the windows script. It will prompt you to enter your username for GitLab. Then enter in the URL of the GitHub repo you would like to move to GitLab. It will clone that repo then create a new repository in GitLab. Once it's done, it will remove that repo locally.

## Why though?
I wanted to move some repos to GitLab but was too lazy to enter in a few more keystrokes.
